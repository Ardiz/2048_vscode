# 2048 Game Rules

## Game Overview
2048 is a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game created by Italian developer Gabriele Cirulli in 2014. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Grid Layout
- The game is played on a 4×4 grid (16 cells total)
- When the game starts, two tiles with the value of either 2 or 4 appear randomly on the grid

### Basic Movements
- Players can slide all tiles in four directions: **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**
- On desktop: Use arrow keys to move tiles
- On mobile: Swipe in the desired direction to move tiles
- All tiles move as far as possible in the chosen direction until they reach the edge of the grid or encounter another tile

### Tile Merging Rules
1. When two tiles with the same number touch while moving, they **merge** into a single tile with the value equal to the sum of the merging tiles
2. The merged tile cannot merge again in the same move
3. After each move, a new tile with a value of either 2 (90% probability) or 4 (10% probability) appears in a random empty cell

### Example of Merging
- If you have tiles [2][2][4][8] in a row and move right, it becomes [empty][empty][4][16]
- If you have tiles [2][2][2][2] in a row and move right, it becomes [empty][empty][4][4]

## Scoring System
- Each time tiles merge, the player earns points equal to the value of the new tile
- For example, merging two 8-tiles gives 16 points
- The game keeps track of the current score and the best (highest) score achieved

## Game End Conditions

### Win Condition
- The game is won when a tile with the value 2048 appears on the board
- Players can choose to continue playing after reaching 2048 to achieve higher scores and larger numbered tiles

### Game Over Condition
- The game ends when there are no empty cells AND no adjacent tiles with the same value
- This means no more moves are possible

## Strategy Tips
- Focus on keeping high-value tiles in the corners
- Maintain a clear path for merging tiles
- Try to keep the board organized with a consistent pattern of increasing values

## Controls Summary
- **↑**: Move all tiles up
- **→**: Move all tiles right
- **↓**: Move all tiles down
- **←**: Move all tiles left
- **New Game** button: Start a new game at any time
